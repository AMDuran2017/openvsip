OpenVSIP has a new website !

This new version uses [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages), which makes it really convenient to add documentation
and other content. Now if only it would allow me to pull docs automatically from 
the master branch, I would be even happier...
