 Sourcery VSIPL++
 Digital Signal Processing Examples
========================================================================

Designing and employing digital filters using Sourcery VSIPL++ is 
accomplished rapidly with relatively few lines of code.  These examples
stand alone, but each builds upon the last.  Reviewing them in order is
recommended but not strictly necessary.

Type 'make' to build the examples, then run them to produce several
raw data files (.view) that can be processed into graphics files
(.svg) by the Matlab/Octave scripts (.m).  These graphics files
are already installed so you can see what the examples do without 
running the scripts.

Moving Average
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  One of the simplest filters to construct, a moving average filter
  is also computationally efficient, though the frequency response
  has high side-lobes and is therefore not ideal.  This example 
  calculates the magnitude of the frequency response for a 5-point
  moving average filter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Low-pass Filter
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Better low-pass filters can be designed using a variety of methods.
  Here, we demostrate the "window method" for filter design and obtain
  the coefficients of a 31-point filter and use the SV++ Finite Impulse
  Response (FIR) object to apply the filter and remove an unwanted
  frequency component.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
High-pass Filter
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Low-pass filters can be modulated (shifted) to create high-pass 
  filters.  This example does so with the low-pass filter created in
  the previous example and removes the low-frequency component, leaving
  the high-frequency one instead.
